  <h2><a id="Requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
  <p>See the README file for a general description of this library. The
  following software should be installed before building the Courier
  authentication library:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The current version of gcc (<a onclick="" href=
    "http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/">http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/</a>)
    </li>
    <li>The GNU linker (<a onclick="" href=
    "http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/">http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/</a>)
    </li>
    <li>Libtool (<a onclick="" href=
    "http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/">http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/</a>).
    Additionally, libtool's <span class="c1">libltdl</span> library, and its
    development files, must be installed. On some platforms this is a separate
    package. On Fedora, this is the <span class="c1">libtool-ltdl-devel</span>
    package, for example.
    </li>
    <li>GNU make (<a onclick="" href=
    "http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">http://www.gnu.org/software/make/</a>)
    </li>
    <li>The "<span class="c1">expect</span>" command. <span class=
    "c1">expect</span> is usually included with most systems. <span class=
    "c1">Expect</span> can be downloaded from <span class=
    "c1">http://expect.nist.gov/</span> if it's not installed on your system.
    This utility is used to change system login passwords, by scripting the
    <span class="c1">passwd</span> command. If you do not have <span class=
    "c1">expect</span> installed you will not be able to change system login
    passwords. However non-system authentication modules (LDAP, PostgreSQL, and
    others) will work.</li>
    <li>Courier Unicode Library. Before installing this package, download and
    install <a onclick="" href=
    "https://www.courier-mta.org/unicode/">https://www.courier-mta.org/unicode/</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Courier-authlib uses Libtool to build shared libraries. Libtool must be
  installed, together with its <span class="c1">libltdl</span> library and its
  header files.</p>
  <p>On non-Linux platforms the GNU linker is also required. Courier-authlib's
  build script uses some GNU linker-specific options. It's possible to manually
  specify the native linker's equivalent options manually, if they exist. If
  the native linker does not have the equivalent options, the GNU linker will
  have to be installed.</p>
  <p>On the other hand, GNU make will be required in almost every case.
  SYSV-derived make variants (probably) will not work.</p>
  <p>The same line of logic also applies to gcc. So, strictly speaking, only a
  basic C compiler, GNU make and libtool, are really needed to build
  courier-authlib. Still, try the following before giving up if problems occur
  when building this package:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Install a recent version of the GNU linker</li>
    <li>Install the current version of Libtool</li>
    <li>Install the current version of gcc</li>
  </ol>
  <h2><a id="Installation">Installation overview</a></h2>
  <h3>rpm and deb packages</h3>
  <p>These are not the same packages as the ones from the distributions'
  repositories. These packages carry a higher internal revision level in order
  to prevent them from getting upgraded by the distributions' packages. This
  packaging exists in order to have a convenient way of updating after a
  release without waiting for the distributions' packages to get built.</p>
  <p><b>NOTE:</b> If a distribution package is already installed it should be
  removed completely before switching to the upstream version (<span class=
  "c1">dnf remove</span> or <span class="c1">apt purge</span>). Preserve any
  existing configuration files, beforehand, in order to restore it after
  switching packages. This applies to all Courier packages. A switch to this
  courier-authlib package requires switching to the courier-unicode package
  too.</p>
  <p><b>NOTE:</b> These packages use their own, generic, installation layout
  that may deviate slightly from the package installation conventions preferred
  by the distributions.</p>
  <h3>rpm</h3>
  <p>Run <span class="c1">dnf install rpm-build</span> if it's not installed
  already, then:</p>
  <pre>rpmbuild -ta courier-authlib-VERSION.tar.bz2</pre>
  <p>If this fails due to any missing dependencies, install them. This builds:
  the main (runtime libraries); a subpackage for each authentication module
  (LDAP, MariaDB/MySQL, etc...); the development (link libraries, header files)
  package. All development libraries needed to build all authentication modules
  must be installed to build the rpms, but do not need to be installed at
  runtime unless the corresponding authentication module rpm is also
  installed.</p>
  <p>This creates rpms that can be installed with "rpm -U":</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The "courier-authlib" package with the commands and standard
    authentication modules.</li>
    <li>The "courier-authlib-devel" package with development libraries and
    header files.</li>
    <li>The "courier-authlib-config-<i>username</i>-<i>groupname</i> package.
    This is a metapackage that captures the user/group used by the
    authentication library (<span class="c1">daemon</span>/<span class=
    "c1">daemon</span>) by default. The dependencies on the metapackage are set
    up in a way to prevent unitended updates to an incompatible newer version
    that's configured with different user and group names.</li>
    <li>Other "courier-authlib-<i>name</i>" authentication modules.</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Using non-default courier username and groupname</h4>
  <p>Pass <span class="c1">--define "mailuser courier"</span> and <span class=
  "c1">--define "mailgroup courier"</span> options to <command />rpmbuild to
  build the library with a non-default user and group name.</p>
  <h3>deb</h3>
  <p>Run "apt install devscripts debhelper", if they're not installed already.
  Create an empty directory and copy/move the tarball into it:</p>
  <pre>
$ mkdir tmp
$ mv courier-authlib-VERSION.tar.bz2 tmp
$ cd tmp</pre>
  <p>Unpack the tarball and cd into the unpacked subdirectory:</p>
  <pre>
$ tar xvf courier-authlib-VERSION.tar.bz2
$ cd courier-authlib-VERSION</pre>
  <p>Run the <span class="c1">courier-debuild</span> script, which is a wrapper
  for <span class="c1">debuild</span>, and forwards its parameters to it:</p>
  <pre>$ ./courier-debuild -us -uc</pre>
  <p>NOTE: the above steps must be followed strictly. The <span class=
  "c1">courier-debuild</span> script expects the distributed tarball in its
  parent directory.</p>
  <p>This eventually produces a deb subdirectory with <span class=
  "c1">.deb</span> packages that can be installed with "dpkg -i":</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The "libcourier-auth" package with the commands and standard
    authentication modules; and "libcourier-auth-<i>&lt;N&gt;</i>" with
    versioned client shared libraries.</li>
    <li>The "libcourier-auth-dev" package with development libraries and header
    files.</li>
    <li>Other "libcourier-auth-<i>name</i>" authentication modules.</li>
    <li>The "<span class=
    "c1">libcourier-auth-config-<i>mailuser</i>-<i>mailgroup</i></span>"
    package. This package sets up the reserved user and group id the library
    and the rest of the Courier packages use. When the built <span class=
    "c1">.deb</span> packages get manually installed directly with <span class=
    "c1">dpkg</span> this "config" package must get installed first, by itself,
    followed by the rest of the packages. Higher level tools, like <span class=
    "c1">apt</span> should figure this out by themselves.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>NOTE: if the courier-debuild script stops with an error complaining about
    missing dependencies, then use "apt install" to install them, then try
    again.</p>
  <pre>$ DEBGCC=10 ./courier-debuild -us -uc</pre>
  <p>Setting the <span class="c1">DEBGCC</span> environment variable selects a
  non-default gcc version.</p>
  <p>NOTE: All Courier packages should be built with the same version of gcc,
  which is selected by the <span class="c1">DEBGCC</span> environment variable
  before running <span class="c1">courier-debuild</span>. <a href=
  "https://www.courier-mta.org/unicode/INSTALL.html">See
  <i>courier-unicode</i>'s <i>INSTALL</i> for more information</a>.</p>
  <h4>Using non-default courier username and groupname</h4>
  <pre>$ mailuser=courier mailgroup=courier ./courier-debuild -us -uc</pre>
  <p>Setting the <span class="c1">mailuser</span> and <span class=
  "c1">mailgroup</span> environment builds the library with a non-default user
  and group name.</p>
  <h3>Maintainer Mode (see README in the git repository to set up)</h3>
  <p><span class="c1">make rpm</span> or <span class="c1">make deb</span>, as
  appropriate, will:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Increment an internal release number.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Run <span class="c1">make dist</span>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Proceed and build a new release, creating the native packages in the
      rpm or deb subdirectory.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Execute either <span class="c1">$HOME/bin/rpmrepos.sh</span> or
      <span class="c1">$HOME/bin/debrepos.sh</span>. This can be a script that
      does nothing, or it's intended to be the maintainer's script that pushes
      out the packages to a repository.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Manual installation</h3>
  <p>The following sequence of commands should be sufficient to install
  courier-authlib in most cases:</p>
  <pre>
./configure [options] [variable=value]*...
make
make install
make install-configure
</pre>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> On the BSD family, GNU make is usually the
    'gmake' command. Use the 'gmake' command, instead of 'make'.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The '<span class="c1">make install-configure</span>' command is required;
  it installs and updates the configuration files; this command must be
  executed when installing courier-authlib for the first time, and when
  upgrading from an older version.</p>
  <h3>Configuration options</h3>
  <p>The configure script takes the usual <span class="c1">autoconf</span>
  options: <span class="c1">--prefix</span>, <span class="c1">--bindir</span>,
  and the rest of the usual toolchain options. The default installation
  directories should be sufficient, though.</p>
  <p><strong>DO NOT USE</strong> the <span class="c1">--disable-static</span>,
  or <span class="c1">--enable-static=no</span> option. Both static and shared
  library options must be enabled for courier-authlib to build properly (but
  see "Post-installation cleanup" below).</p>
  <h4><span class="c1">--without-stdheaderdir</span></h4>
  <p>The default configuration installs development files in <span class=
  "c1">/usr/local/include</span> (see "What gets installed", below). This
  directory is usually in the compiler's search path for header files. This
  option must be specified if the compiler does NOT search for header files in
  <span class="c1">/usr/local/include</span> by default.</p>
  <p>This option must also be specified if other configuration options (such as
  <span class="c1">--prefix</span> or <span class="c1">--includedir</span>)
  specify a different installation directory, and the new directory is also not
  searched by the compiler, by default</p>
  <h4><span class="c1">--with-mailuser=<em>userid</em>,
  --with-mailgroup=<em>groupid</em></span></h4>
  <p>"userid" is a reserved system username, "groupid" is a reserved system
  groupname. These two options should be used before installing Courier for the
  first time. These options are not required before installing Courier-IMAP or
  SqWebMail.</p>
  <p>These options specify the user/group that will own the configuration
  files, and the socket that authentication daemon process listens on. This is
  a key part of Courier's security model.</p>
  <p>These options should not be necessary if upgrading from an earlier version
  of Courier and/or this authentication library. The default userid and groupid
  are computed as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If an earlier version of the Courier authentication library is already
    installed in the same directory, the userid and the groupid is the same as
    the earlier version, otherwise:</li>
    <li>The userid is the first userid from the following list which exists in
    the system: courier, daemon, adm, bin, root; and the groupid is the first
    groupid from the following list which exists in the system: courier,
    daemon, adm, sys, root.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When installing Courier authentication library for the first time, it is
  highly recommended to create a "courier" userid and groupid, so that
  specifying these options will not be necessary.</p>
  <h4><span class="c1">VARIABLE=</span><em><span class=
  "c1">value</span></em></h4>
  <p>Environment variables may be set either before running the configure
  script, or by providing the environment variables as parameters to the
  configure script. Example:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>
./configure --with-mailuser=mail --with-mailgroup=mail \
     CC=gcc-10 CXX=g++-10 LDFLAGS=-L/opt/fsf/lib \
     MAKE=gmake
</pre>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The <span class="c1">CC</span> and <span class="c1">CXX</span> environment
  variables specify the C compiler that will be used to compile the
  authentication library. <span class="c1">LDFLAGS</span> specifies additiona
  linker flags, etc...</p>
  <h2><a id="deps">Dependencies</a></h2>
  <p>On a minimum, bare-bones system, the Courier authentication library builds
  support for garden-variety authentication against system accounts (from the
  system's password file, <span class="c1">/etc/passwd</span>).</p>
  <p>If the <span class="c1">configure</span> script detects that certain
  optional software components are installed, additional authentication modules
  will be built and installed. This chapter describes what needs to be
  installed in order to build the optional authentication modules.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> In all cases, it is not sufficient to install the
    runtime support libraries for the following components. In order to build
    the authentication modules the <strong>DEVELOPMENT LIBRARIES</strong> for
    the following software packages must be installed. The development
    libraries are usually a separate package, that must be installed in
    addition to the package that adds alleged support for the following
    software libraries.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>GDBM or Berkeley DB library</strong> - The <span class=
    "c1">userdb</span> authentication module will be built if either library is
    installed. The <span class="c1">userdb</span> authentication module
    includes Perl scripts that maintain a list of available accounts in plain
    text files. A Perl script then compiles the account list into a binary
    database, either GDBM or DB, which is then used to look up account
    information.</li>
    <li><strong>OpenLDAP</strong> - The LDAP authentication modules requires
    OpenLDAP client libraries to be installed. Sometimes there's some confusion
    when commercial LDAP servers are used, which come with their own
    development toolkits, which use a different API than OpenLDAP. Even if a
    commercial LDAP server is used to provide LDAP services, OpenLDAP is still
    required to enable LDAP services in Courier.</li>
    <li><strong>MariaDB/MySQL</strong>, <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, and
    <strong>SQLite</strong> - The MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and SQLite
    authentication modules require, obviously, MariaDB/PostgreSQL/SQLite
    development libraries.<br /></li>
  </ul>
  <h2><a id="What">What gets installed</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="c1">/usr/local/etc/authlib</span> - the configuration
    files.</li>
    <li><span class="c1">/usr/local/sbin</span> - the authdaemond startup
    script; several utility programs (courierlogger, authconfig, authtest,
    authenumerate); and userdb scripts.</li>
    <li><span class="c1">/usr/local/lib/courier-authlib</span> - various
    authentication modules, as shared libraries.</li>
    <li><span class="c1">/usr/local/libexec/courier-authlib</span> - some
    miscellaneous stuff.</li>
    <li><span class="c1">/usr/local/var/authdaemon</span> - a subdirectory that
    contains the filesystem socket which authdaemond listens on.</li>
    <li><span class="c1">/usr/local/include</span> - a header file that Courier
    packages will use to build against courier-authlib.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Toolchain options to the <span class="c1">configure</span> script may be
  used to select alternative installation directories for these components.</p>
  <h3>Post-installation cleanup</h3>
  <p>On most systems, after running <span class="c1">make
  install-configure</span> all static libraries can be removed from the
  <span class="c1">/usr/local/lib/courier-authlib</span> directory:</p>
  <p><span class="c1">rm -rf /usr/local/lib/courier-authlib/*.a</span></p>
  <p>The Courier authentication library uses only the shared libraries. The
  static versions of the shared libraries are not used. They are installed by
  default, via libtool, but are not really needed. On most platforms the
  libtool files, "*.la" can also be removed. Do not remove any soft links.</p>
  <h2><a id="manpage">For more information</a></h2>
  <p>Following "<span class="c1">make install</span>", see the <a href=
  "README_authlib.html"><span class="c1">README_authlib.html</span></a> file
  for details on setting up the authentication modules. The <span class=
  "c1">README_authlib.html</span> file gets assembled as part of the build
  process.</p>
  <p>Before proceding to install any other packages, be sure to verify that the
  authentication library is working by running the <span class=
  "c1">authtest</span> command, as documented in the <span class=
  "c1">README_authlib.html</span> file.</p>
  <h2><a id="Starting">Starting and stopping the authentication daemon</a></h2>
  <p>Arrangements must be made to run the <span class=
  "c1">courier-authlib.sysvinit</span> script with "start" and "stop"
  parameters at system startup and shutdown. <span class="c1">make
  install</span> does not install this script from the source directory, it
  needs to be installed manually.</p>
  <h2><a id="Guidelines">Guidelines for using other package managers</a></h2>
  <p>The recommended way to build packages can be inferred from the RPM build
  script. It is summarized here for convenience:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Decide whether or not Courier-specific userid and groupid needs to be
    created, and, if so, make the necessary arrangements.</li>
    <li>Ensure that all prerequisite development libraries are available.</li>
    <li>Run the <span class="c1">configure</span> script, run <span class=
    "c1">make</span>, then <span class="c1">make install</span> as usual.</li>
    <li>Copy the "<span class="c1">sysconftool</span>" script somewhere into
    the installation tree. A good place would be <span class=
    "c1">%libexecdir%/courier-authlib</span>. This is the '<span class=
    "c1">make install-upgrade</span>' command. Don't run this at build time.
    Instead, arrange for the package installation script to run the
    "<span class="c1">sysconftool %sysconfdir%/authlib/*.dist</span>" after the
    package is installed <strong>OR UPGRADED</strong>.</li>
    <li>The "<span class="c1">authdaemond</span>", "<span class=
    "c1">authenumerate</span>", and "<span class="c1">authtest</span>" commands
    can be renamed, to avoid name clashes.</li>
    <li>There are two types of libraries that get installed in <span class=
    "c1">%libdir%</span>:
      <ol>
        <li>Common libraries that application link with, <span class=
        "c1">libcourier*</span>.</li>
        <li>Dynamically-loaded authentication modules: <span class=
        "c1">libauth*</span>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Remove all static libraries from <span class=
      "c1">%libdir%/courier-authlib</span>. Keep the <span class=
      "c1">*.la</span> and <span class="c1">*.so</span> for <span class=
      "c1">libcourier*</span>, and include them in a devel subpackage. Remove
      <span class="c1">*.la</span> and <span class="c1">*.so</span> for all
      <span class="c1">libauth*</span> libraries, they are not needed.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Now, create the installable packages, as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="c1">%libdir%/courier-authlib/libauthldap*</span> goes into
    the LDAP subpackage.</li>
    <li><span class="c1">%libdir%/courier-authlib/libauthmysql*</span> goes
    into the MariaDB/MySQL subpackage.</li>
    <li><span class="c1">%libdir%/courier-authlib/libauthsqlite*</span> goes
    into the SQLite subpackage.</li>
    <li><span class="c1">%libdir%/courier-authlib/libauthpgsql*</span> goes
    into the PostgreSQL subpackage.</li>
    <li><span class="c1">%libdir%/courier-authlib/libauthuserdb*</span> goes
    into the userdb subpackage.</li>
    <li>Everything else can go into the main package. Optionally, the
    <span class="c1">courierauthconfig</span> binary, stuff in <span class=
    "c1">%includedir%</span>, and in <span class="c1">%mandir%/man3</span>, can
    go into a devel subpackage.</li>
  </ul>
