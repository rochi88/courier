Description: Configuration file tool
 sysconftool is a script that is used by applications to update configuration
 files when a new version of the application is installed. sysconftool reads
 the new application configuration files, reads any older versions of those
 files that are already installed, then replaces the old versions with the
 new ones, but preserving any custom changes contained in the old versions.
