# This is a shared repository by all Courier-related projects. Each project
# is in a separate subdirectory.
#
# Some additional setup is needed before hacking on the source code. All
# projects also pull a shared repository that contains modules that are
# shared by multiple Courier projects. If you want to hack the "courier"
# project, you must pull the shared repository into the courier/libs directory.
#
# To set up a project directory, run this script with two parameters:
#
# A) the project directory to set up.
# B) The URL to the shared library module git repository.
#
# For example:
#
# sh INSTALLME courier http://www.example.com/courier-libs.git
#
# The URL for the shared library module is purposefully not given in this
# INSTALLME in case it changes in the future. If you're reading this INSTALLME,
# you should already know what it is.
#
# What this script does is as follows:

projdir="$1"
gitrepo="$2"

set -e

# 1) Pull in the shared module git repo

cd $projdir
git clone $gitrepo libs

# Now, run the autobloat script to rebuild the autotools
# stuff. You must have autoconf, autoconf-archive, automake, libtool,
# and gettext packages installed.

sh ./autobloat
